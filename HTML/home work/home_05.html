    <h1>Python Features and Advantages</h1>
    <p>
        Python is a very high-level programming language, yet it is effortless to learn.<br>
         Anyone can learn to code in Python in just a few hours or a few days.<br>
         Mastering Python and all its advanced concepts, packages and modules might take some more time.<br>
         However, learning the basic Python syntax is very easy, as compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. 
    </p>
    <h2> Easy to Read</h2>
    <p>
        Python code looks like simple English words.<br>
        There is no use of semicolons or brackets, and the indentations define the code block.<br>
        You can tell what the code is supposed to do simply by looking at it. 
    </p>
    <h3>Free and Open-Source</h3>
    <p>
        Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license.<br>
        Hence, it is completely free to use, even for commercial purposes. <br>
        It doesn't cost anything to download Python or to include it in your application.<br>
        It can also be freely modified and re-distributed. Python can be downloaded from the official Python website.
        Let us find out the next feature of python.

    <h4> Robust Standard Library</h4>
    <p>
        Python has an extensive standard library available for anyone to use.<br> 
        This means that programmers donâ€™t have to write their code for every single thing unlike other programming languages.<br>
        There are libraries for image manipulation, databases, unit-testing, expressions and a lot of other functionalities.<br>
        In addition to the standard library, there is also a growing collection of thousands of components, which are all available in the Python Package Index.
